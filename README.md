#PokéMath 


##Description
*PokéMath* is designed to make practicing math simple and enjoyable by combining the classic game, Pokémon, with math questions. 

The idea is that a user navigates through the map encountering pokémon. The user battles the pokémon if encountered.  A pokémon is encountered by moving towards its place on the board.

Battles consist of solving math problems within the alotted amount of time. If all the questions are answered correctly, you catch the pokémon-- it's saved to your profile/PokéDex where your other caught pokémon can be viewed.

If a question is answered incorrectly or if time runs out before all the questions are answered, the pokémon your battling escapes. At the end of the battle the user is directed back to the map to go catch more pokémon!
